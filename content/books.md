Books is a platform that hosts electronic books from a variety of publishers, allowing OCUL members to store their digital content in a single place. It currently holds over 1,000,000 books from over 20 academic publishers. The site features an online web reader, a flexible DRM system, internationalization, and a built-in accessible content portal (ACE) where users can download the full text versions of all the content they are entitled to.
